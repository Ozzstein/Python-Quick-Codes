    "# Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a course for researchers, scientists, engineers, and scientific programmers who are interested in using Python for solving computational problems that arise in daily scientific work and automating the processing of different kinds of scientific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the course, you will have all the knowledge you need to start programming competently in Python for scientific applications. You will know what's available with Python and how to use its powerful data types and amazing libraries and amazing libraries to write clean, efficient code. You will have had experience with using Python for various scientific data manipulation tasks and solving a range of analytical, including easily creating beautiful plots, performing Monte Carlo simulations, constructing statistical models, regression, analysing time-series data, images, and (time permitting) gridded geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each topic is a mixture of hands-on exercises and expert instruction.\n",

    "## Course outline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 1: Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 1 covers the basics of using the Python language and standard library, with a focus on scientific and engineering applications, including tips and tricks for making this easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why use Python? What’s possible?\n",
    "- The Jupyter notebook and shell for rapid prototyping\n",
    "- Modules and packages\n",
    "- Python syntax and concepts: an introduction through examples\n",
    "- Essential data types, tips and tricks\n",
    "- Handling exceptions\n",
    "- Worked example: fetching and ranking real-time temperature data from a web API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 2: Handling, Analysing, and Presenting Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas package is an amazingly productive tool for working with tabular data in Python. Day 2 gives a comprehensive introduction to reading and writing some of the most important data formats in science and how to analyse, summarise, and visualise data easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading and writing essential data formats: CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, time-series\n",
    "- Indexing and selecting data in Pandas\n",
    "- Data fusion: joining & merging datasets\n",
    "- Summarisation with “group by” operations; pivot tables\n",
    "- Time-series analysis: parsing dates, resampling\n",
    "- Visualisation and statistical graphics with Seaborn and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day 3: Essentials of Scientific Computing with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 3 teaches the use of Python for numerical and scientific computing. It covers array manipulation and an overview of available scientific routines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays\n",
    "  - Introduction to manipulating vectors and matrices with NumPy\n",
    "  - NumPy essentials: data types, boolean & “fancy” indexing\n",
    "  - Introduction to extracting gridded data from HDF5 and NetCDF files\n",
    "- Scientific computing packages\n",
    "  - Tour of SciPy and related packages for scientific computing, with topics selected from:\n",
    "  - unit conversions\n",
    "  - dense & sparse linear algebra\n",
    "  - image processing\n",
    "  - clustering\n",
    "  - interpolation\n",
    "  - statistics: regression, density estimation, confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We would be happy to incorporate some of your own datasets into the exercises if desired to make the exercises as relevant as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplemental materials\n",
    "\n",
    "We will supply you with printed course notes and a USB stick containing electronic versions of the course notes as Jupyter notebooks, solutions to the programming exercises, several written tutorials, and reference documentation on Python and the third-party packages covered in the course.\n",
